Translation operators for various flavors of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) are a minimal pre-computation for translation-invariant Green's functions and modal Green's functions. This is due to the fact that for these functions many translation operators on various levels the computational domain are the same, and so need not be repeatedly computed. However, for a translation-variant Green's function or modal Green's function this is not immediately clear. Until now one may have needed to compute all possible translation operators between all boxes in the computational domain. This thesis shows that lightening the pre-computational load of the translation operators for the FMM is possible for translation-variant modal Green's functions. Specifically we examine the application to the translation operators of the three-dimensional kernel-independent FMM for Laplace's equation.
