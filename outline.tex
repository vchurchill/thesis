\title{Thesis Outline -- the problem of axisymmetric BOR}

\section{}
%\subsection{}
What is an axisymmetric surface of revolution? Why are these type of densities useful and sought after?
\section{}
What is a modal Green's function? What is translation invariant kernel? What are the problems associated with this?
\section{}
Why is an analytic FMM for a modal Green's function difficult? The problem with evaluating special functions -- Bessel or Hankel functions.
\section{}
So we're left to kernel-independent methods.
\section{}
Why not use the typical KIFMM from Ying, Biros, and Zorin? Pre-computation is not optimal because of translation operators.
\section{}
We now consider using the black-box FMM or a Chebyshev interpolation-based scheme. Consider that for each mode n, the computation of the weights is simply a matrix
$W_{m_1,m_2}=\sum_{j=1}^N \sigma_j R_n(\mathbf{\overline{y}}_{m_1,m_2},\mathbf{y}_j)$
